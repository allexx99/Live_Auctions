# Live_Auctions

Welcome to the Live Auctions Application repository! This project showcases a dynamic web platform designed for users to interact with auction listings efficiently and intuitively.

Some of the most important features of the app are:

1. Listing objects for auction: Users can list new items for auction, specifying details such as the item description, starting bid, and auction duration.
2. Listing Details Page: Users can access detailed information about each auction listing, including the current price, by clicking on a listing.
3. Watchlist Management: Signed-in users can add items to or remove items from their "Watchlist," allowing them to easily track their favorite auctions.
4. Bidding System: Registered users can place bids on auction items. Bids must meet or exceed the starting price and surpass any existing bids to be valid. Invalid bids are met with an error message to guide users.
5. Data Export: Users have the option to export auction data into an XML file for convenient sharing and record-keeping.
6. Real-Time Notifications: Notifications about new auction listings are delivered in real-time via WebSockets, keeping users instantly informed about the latest additions.
7. Feed Filtering and Sorting: Users can filter and sort posts on the feed page in ascending and descending order, making it easy to find relevant auction listings.
